Last week, I attended the Data Study Group (DSG) at the Alan Turing Institute in London as a Principal Investigator. I helped Telenor, a giant Norwegian telecom company to shape a data science challenge to bring to the DSG, which is a collaborative hackathon organised by the Alan Turing Institute. Unlike other hackathon, participants at the DSG work together to solve practical problems raised by an industry partner.

The project I was the Principal Investigator is called GreenRadio, where we came up with AI solutions to turn off mobile sectors in mobile towers during off-peak periods to save energy and to reduce our carbon footprints. It was also a great honour to meet and to work with the Data Scientist all over the UK during the DSG week.

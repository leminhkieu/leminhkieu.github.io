Last week I presented at a workshop by the Alan Turing Institute, UK and the Tongji University in Shanghai, China entitled "Urban analytics at the interface between environment, human health and behaviour" ([Link](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/urban-analytics-interface-between-environment-human-health-and-behaviour)). It was great meeting the Urban Analytics experts in the UK and China. I presented about "Data-driven cities: bringing together machine learning and city simulation" ([Slides](https://leminhkieu.github.io/p/2019-DynamicCities-UrbanAnalytics#/title)). The presentation was well received by the workshop participants.

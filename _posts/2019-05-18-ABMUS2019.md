Last week [Alison Heppenstall](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1046/professor-alison-heppenstall) and [I](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=mjpqmUsAAAAJ&hl=en) attended the international conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems ([AAMAS](http://aamas2019.encs.concordia.ca/)) and presented at the workshop on Agent-Based Modelling and Urban Systems ([ABMUS](http://www.modelling-urban-systems.com/abmus2019)). My presentation was entitled: Reducing the impacts of uncertainty in agent-based models for real-time applications ([slides](https://leminhkieu.github.io/p/2019-05-14-ABMUS-BusSim-MK.html)) and Alison's was entitled: State Estimation and Data Assimilation for an Agent-Based Model using a Probabilistic Framework ([slides](https://urban-analytics.github.io/dust/p/2019-05-14-abmus-keanu_probabilistic.html))

I am also getting myself involved in the organisation and chairing of the next ABMUS workshop in Auckland, New Zealand!

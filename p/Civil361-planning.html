                *** 1. Air quality
                The importance of a transportation planning process is that if advanced technology is used creatively, then it will improve the air quality and reduce air pollution
                       
		         *** 2. Minimizing the impact on climate change
                It is a hard fact to face that pollution has increased because of transportation emission. It is the need of the hour to enhance technology so that it can result in cleaner fuels. It should be the priority of people who are involved in transportation planning to upgrade the infrastructure so that people can choose less polluting methods of transportation.

                    The model predicts the trips produced by a zone by simply aggregating the total trips produced by all the households in that zone. However, two basic questions need to be answered here: (i) how do we define similar households, or alternatively how do we define categories of households, and (ii) how do we determine the rate of trip-generation for a given category of households. The answer to both these questions is: through empirical observations and analysis. What is done is that, first, data on demographic characteristics and trip -making behaviour of a large number of households are collected. This data is then analyzed to see what characteristics of the households are important in defining a homogeneous group -- the households which produce approximately the same number of trips.

                    Based on the above analysis, tables are made which define each category of households by listing its properties in terms of different demographic variables. For example, a particular category of households may be defined as households with 3 to 4 members in the age group 6 to 60, with income in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 per month, and one automobile. Finally, for each category of household the average number of trips generated are listed. The listing of the definition of categories and the associated trip -generation rates are generally referred to as trip tables.

                       This method of analysis although simple in its structure has few difficulties. The foremost is the problem with defining categories correctly -- at best it is very difficult. There are other problems like handling additional data on trip-generation behaviour -- the trip tables are not amenable to simple updating but generally have to be completely revamped every time new data is available.

                    The model predicts the trips produced by a zone by simply aggregating the total trips produced by all the households in that zone. However, two basic questions need to be answered here: (i) how do we define similar households, or alternatively how do we define categories of households, and (ii) how do we determine the rate of trip-generation for a given category of households. The answer to both these questions is: through empirical observations and analysis. What is done is that, first, data on demographic characteristics and trip -making behaviour of a large number of households are collected. This data is then analyzed to see what characteristics of the households are important in defining a homogeneous group -- the households which produce approximately the same number of trips.

                    Based on the above analysis, tables are made which define each category of households by listing its properties in terms of different demographic variables. For example, a particular category of households may be defined as households with 3 to 4 members in the age group 6 to 60, with income in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 per month, and one automobile. Finally, for each category of household the average number of trips generated are listed. The listing of the definition of categories and the associated trip -generation rates are generally referred to as trip tables.

                       This method of analysis although simple in its structure has few difficulties. The foremost is the problem with defining categories correctly -- at best it is very difficult. There are other problems like handling additional data on trip-generation behaviour -- the trip tables are not amenable to simple updating but generally have to be completely revamped every time new data is available.

                        <h3>Step 1: Trip generation: The regression model </h3>
                        
                        <p> In this model an additive functional form is assumed to exist between the factors which affect trip-generation and the number of trips generated. Generally, a linear function of the following form is used:</p>
                    
                        
                            \[\begin{aligned}
                            T_i = \alpha_1 z_{1,i} + \alpha_2 z_{2,i} + ... + \alpha_n z_{n,i}\\
                            \end{aligned} \]
                        
                        <p class="l2"> $\alpha_k$ parameter of the regression function</p>
                        <p class="l2"> $z_{k,i}$ value of the $k$ variable (e.g. income, age, car ownership)</p>
                      
                   <aside class="notes">
                    As can be seen using this model to determine the number of trips generated by a zone is a simple matter when all the parameters of the regression function are known. Obviously, the parameters are determined by using some parameter estimation technique like Ordinary Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood Technique on empirically obtained data on $z_k$ variables and $T_i$. For a good description of regression analysis and the parameter estimation techniques mentioned here, one may refer to any book on introductory statistical methods or basic econometrics; 

                    Discussion: Generally the models of trip-generation include variables which reflect the number of potential trip makers and the propensity of potential trip-makers to make a trip. However, none of the present models incorporate variables which reflect the accessibility factor. This is possibly the single largest factor as to why trip-generation models cannot very well predict the number of trips generated.

                        <p> The main barrier to engagement in active transport is perceived lack of safety.  Active transport users are also vulnerable road users (those who WALK and CYCLE) </p>

                        Zealanders Attitudes and perceptions of cycling, found that
                        75% of adults would cycle if the roads were safer</p>
                        <p class="l2">A New Zealand research suggests that the risk of cycling is
                        lower than DIY (do-it-yourself repairs), horse riding, skiing
                        and rugby.</p>

With the use of smartphones, many crashes occur due to the pedestrian not paying attention, pedestrians crossing the roadway at mid-block and when visibility is poor.

                    <p>After cycling infrastructure was built in
                    Melbourne, peak-hour cycling increased from
                    9% in 2008, to 16% in 2017 overall. And up to 35% in some roads</p> 
                                         <p class="l2">The
                    comprehensive approach included an overall
                    plan, increased cycle routes, bike shares, bike
                    parks and an annual cycle census.</p>  
                                         <p class="l2">The increased infrastructure has created
                    opportunities for additional investment</p>

                     <h4>Pedestrian environment concept 1: Sharing the main street</h4>
                     <p>The main streets of rural towns, and minor arterial roads in cities that are straddled by strips of retail, commercial and community activities, have conflicting traffic and pedestrian needs that need to be managed. Pedestrian crashes cluster at such locations. </p>  

                         <p class="l2">Sharing the main street means adapting it – or a centre along a minor arterial road – to improve the safety and the quality
                                    of the road environment for all its users.  </p>  
                      <p class="l2">Example: Parnell Rd, Auckland</p>

                     <h4>Pedestrian environment concept 2: Living streets </h4>
                     <p>The concept of ‘living streets’ recognises that, as a priority, streets should be
                        designed with living and community interaction. While cars are not
                        excluded, they are designed so drivers are aware they are in an area where
                        pedestrian and other users are important
                        </p>

                     <h4>Pedestrian environment concept 3: Shared zones</h4>
                     <p>A shared zone is a residential or retail street that has been designed to give priority to residents and pedestrians while significantly reducing the dominance of motorised vehicles</p>  

                         <p class="l2">Motorised vehicles still have access but must give way to pedestrians; and
conversely pedestrians should not hinder vehicles. The route is physically constrained for vehicles by landscaping, structures
and tight turning radii, with no delineation between the footpath and roadway.  </p>

                     <h4>Pedestrian environment concept 4:  Pedestrian precincts </h4>
                     <p>Most pedestrian-only areas are created by restricting traffic access or closing roads to traffic. Four types:  </p>  
                        
                        <p class="l2">1. Modified street precinct: one block is closed for pedestrian-only use.</p>
                        <p class="l2">2. Plaza: several blocks are closed but the cross-streets stay open to all traffic.</p>
                        <p class="l2">3. Continuous: several blocks and the cross-streets are closed.</p>
                        <p class="l2">4. Displaced: walkways are developed away from the usual roadside footpaths, making use of lanes and alleys.</p>

                      <p>A bicycle network is made up of a series of bicycle routes connected together to link many origins to many destinations. Thereby, an effective network has no or small gaps which links routes seamlessly.</p>
                        <p>There are two main types of network – utility (or functional) network and recreational network.  </p>
                        
                        <p class="l2"><a>Utility network: </a>Connects destinations for functional trip purposes, including shopping, work, education etc. Connections should be as direct as possible as utility cyclists want to get from A to B as quickly as possible.  </p>
                        
                        <p class="l2"><a>Recreational network: </a>Recreational routes can pass through urban areas/centres (and therefore also form part of the utility network), but the focus is on leisure cycling. They can include signed long-distance routes, signed tourist themed routes or a collection of nodes and interconnected links, enabling cyclists to determine their own trip. Recreational cyclists are typically looking for a leisurely and attractive ride, which can allow them to explore an area, exercise or socialise.  </p>

                         <p>The primary goal of designing and constructing bicycle networks is to create high-quality space in which cyclist can ride. </p>
                         
                          <p class="l2">Method 1: Reduce the width of parking and/or traffic lanes. This is a low cost method.</p>
                          <p class="l2">Method 2: Seal shoulders: Gravel shoulders can be sealed to provide cycle lanes.</p>
                          <p class="l2">Method 3: Indent car parking: This removes parked cars from through lanes and thus reduces cyclist from being “squished” by parked cars and traffic.</p>
                          <p class="l2">Method 4: Prohibiting car parking: Use the lanes for cyclists. </p>

                         <p class="l2">Method 5: Widen the road into the median: Reducing the width of medians can provide space for cycle lanes. However, it must be ensured that medians are wide enough to accommodate turning lanes.</p>
                          <p class="l2">Method 6: Remove traffic lane: Some roads may have too many lanes for its traffic flow.</p>
                          <p class="l2">Method 7: High standard off-road paths: Depending on the volume of cyclists, consideration should be given to a high-standard off-road path that provides equivalent connectivity, continuity and service. </p>
                          <p>To determine the most appropriate method, the costs and benefits to society needs to be weighed.  </p>

                        <p> <a>1. Coherence:</a> Routes should be continuous and consistent standard throughout. Gaps in cycle routes are often dangerous for cyclists, particularly at difficult intersections. Routes should be signposted to destinations with distances included. Maps showing surrounding land use and road system is also good practice. </p>
                         
                      <p><a>2. Directness:</a> Reduce delay for cyclists. Poorly designed facilities can often cause delay. Delays should be less than 15-20 seconds/km on primary routes. Features which slow cyclist down should be avoid, as it takes time and effort for them accelerate. </p>

                        <p><a>3. Attractiveness:</a> Cycle routes should integrate with and complement their surroundings to enhance security and contribute to the experience. This is a key feature to increasing the usability of the route </p>
                        
                        <p><a>4. Safety:  </a>Contributing factors to the safety of the cyclist is traffic speed and volume and intersections. </p>
                  
                         <p><a>5. Comfort:  </a> It is important for the routes to be smooth, non-slip, well maintained and free of debris. Attention must be given to any other obstructions such as manholes and obstructions. </p>

                    <h4>The most important aspects can be considered to be safety, directness and cohesion.  </h4>
                    
                    <p class="l2"><a>Safety:</a> Avoiding conflict with crossing traffic, separating different types of road users where necessary due to traffic volumes/speeds, reducing speed at points of conflict, ensuring good visibility of cyclists, and ensuring that there are recognisable road categories. </p>
                     
                    <p class="l2"><a>Directness:</a> distance or time required to cycle between the origin and destination. In urban areas, it is desirable for cycling to be quicker than driving, which can be achieved through providing more direct routes for bicycles rather than for cars. To maximise directness there should also be minimal detours, good priority for bicycles, and the ability for cyclists to maintain constant speeds. The directness of a route in distance can be determined by a detour factor.</p>
                     
                    <p class="l2"><a>Cohesion:</a> ensures clear wayfinding and minimal interruption. There should be a consistent high quality of provision across the network and all common trip origins and destinations within a city should be accessible by bike and connected to the network. Intermodal cohesion is also desirable, enabling and encouraging cycling trips as a means of transport to and from public transport nodes.  Without cohesion there cannot be a cycle network, only a collection of single cycle routes. </p>

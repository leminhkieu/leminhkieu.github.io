		              For cost, environmental impact, and other reasons, roadways are not typically  designed to provide LOS A conditions during peak periods, but rather some lower  LOS that reflects a balance between individual traveller's desires and society’s  desires and financial resources. Nevertheless, during low-volume period of the  day, a system element may operate at LOS A.

                        2-ft right-side lateral clearance, and 9 ramps within 3 miles upstream and 3 miles
                        downstream of the midpoint of the analysis segment. A directional weekday peak-hour
                        volume of 3000 vehicles is observed, with 810 vehicles arriving in the most congested 15-
                        min period. If the traffic stream has 10% single-unit trucks and 10% tractor-trailer trucks,
                        determine the level of service. Assume SAF =1 and CAF = 1.</p>

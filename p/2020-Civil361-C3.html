		            <p>From dictionary: "the maximum amount that something can contain."</p>
                       
                    <p class="l2">The capacity of a car park is obviously the maximum number of cars. It can nevertheless be measured relatively  easily. However, the capacity of a particular section of road is not as easily  determined as it depends upon the speed of the traffic and other factors.</p>
                   
                   <p class="l2">Vehicle capacity is the maximum number of vehicles that can pass a given point during a specified period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions. This assumes that there is no influence from downstream traffic operation, such as queues backing into the analysis point.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. Highway Capacity Manual, or HCM, is the primary reference for traffic operational analysis, methodologies, and level of service (LOS) concepts in the United States, as well as many other countries. </p>
                            
                          <p>  The HCM is a collection of concepts and methods that guide analysts on how to evaluate a particular type of intersection or roadway segment, based on what can be extensive national or international datasets of operational performance. </p>

                        <h3>Introduction to the HCM</h3>
                        
                        <p>The first edition in 1950. It quantifies the concept of capacity for transportation facilities</p>
                        
                        <p>Three types of highway capacity were defined:</p>
                        <p class="l2">Practical capacity - reasonable operating conditions </p>
                        <p class="l2">Possible capacity - maximum, under prevailing conditions</p>
                        <p class="l2">Ideal capacity - maximum, under ideal conditions.</p>

                        <p> The second edition in 1965, introduced the concept of level of  service (LOS) as a means to quantify the operational quality provided by the  highway/street to the drivers and passengers.</p>
                        
                        <p> The latest fifth edition HCM 2016 is intended to encourage analysts and decision  makers to consider all roadway users, as well as a broader range of performance measures, when they assess transportation facilities’ performance.</p>

                        <p> Capacity and quality-of-service analyses have generated interest on an 
                    international scale. The HCM has been translated into several languages, and 
                    research conducted in numerous countries outside of North America has 
                    contributed to the development of HCM methodologies. </p>
                        
                   <p> Although there is considerable value in the general methods presented, their use 
                    outside of North America requires an emphasis on calibration of the equations 
                    and procedures to local conditions 
                    </p>

                        <p class="l2"> HCM 2010 and 2016 are available only in Imperial units (ft/mile) contrary to HCM 2000, which was available in Metric version as well.</p>

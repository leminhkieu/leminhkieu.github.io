		            <p>From dictionary: "the maximum amount that something can contain."</p>
                       
                    <p class="l2">The capacity of a car park is obviously the maximum number of cars. It can nevertheless be measured relatively  easily. However, the capacity of a particular section of road is not as easily  determined as it depends upon the speed of the traffic and other factors.</p>
                   
                   <p class="l2">Vehicle capacity is the maximum number of vehicles that can pass a given point during a specified period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions. This assumes that there is no influence from downstream traffic operation, such as queues backing into the analysis point.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. Highway Capacity Manual, or HCM, is the primary reference for traffic operational analysis, methodologies, and level of service (LOS) concepts in the United States, as well as many other countries. </p>
                            
                          <p>  The HCM is a collection of concepts and methods that guide analysts on how to evaluate a particular type of intersection or roadway segment, based on what can be extensive national or international datasets of operational performance. </p>

                        <h3>Introduction to the HCM</h3>
                        
                        <p>The first edition in 1950. It quantifies the concept of capacity for transportation facilities</p>
                        
                        <p>Three types of highway capacity were defined:</p>
                        <p class="l2">Practical capacity - reasonable operating conditions </p>
                        <p class="l2">Possible capacity - maximum, under prevailing conditions</p>
                        <p class="l2">Ideal capacity - maximum, under ideal conditions.</p>

                        <p> The second edition in 1965, introduced the concept of level of  service (LOS) as a means to quantify the operational quality provided by the  highway/street to the drivers and passengers.</p>
                        
                        <p> The latest fifth edition HCM 2016 is intended to encourage analysts and decision  makers to consider all roadway users, as well as a broader range of performance measures, when they assess transportation facilities’ performance.</p>

                         <p class="l2">Volume – the total number of vehicles that pass over a given point or section of a  lane or roadway during a given time interval; any time interval can be used, but  volume are typically expressed in terms of annual, daily, hourly, or sub-hourly  periods.</p>
                        
                        <p class="l2"> Flow Rate (v) – the equivalent hourly rate at which vehicles pass over a given point  or section of a lane or roadway during a given time interval of less than one hour,  usually 15 minutes. </p>
                        
                        <p class="l2">Peak Hourly Volume (PHV) - PHV is the maximum flow observed over any 1 hour period. In urban areas where tidal flows are common, it is usual to have two PHV’s, one for the A.M. and other for P.M. In rural areas it is sufficient to use only one PHV.</p>

                             <p> Density is the number of vehicles occupying a given length of a lane or roadway at  a particular instant.  </p>

					D = \frac{v_p}{S} \\

		              For the computations in HCM, density is averaged over time  and is usually expressed as veh/km or passenger car unit per km. 
                      Measuring density directly in the field is difficult: it requires a vantage point for photographing, videotaping, or observing significant lengths of highway. Density  can be computed, however, from the average travel speed (S) and flow rate, which  are measured more easily.

		              For cost, environmental impact, and other reasons, roadways are not typically  designed to provide LOS A conditions during peak periods, but rather some lower  LOS that reflects a balance between individual traveller's desires and society’s  desires and financial resources. Nevertheless, during low-volume period of the  day, a system element may operate at LOS A.

               <p>Service measures are performance measures used to define LOS for 
                   transportation system elements.  </p>

                   	<p class="l2"> should reflect travellers' perceptions </p>
                    <p class="l2"> should be useful to operating agencies</p>
                   <p class="l2"> should be directly measurable in the field</p>
                   <p class="l2"> should be estimable given a set of known or forecast conditions</p>
                   
       
                     <aside class="notes">
		               Neither LOS nor any other single performance measure tells the full story of  roadway performance. Depending on the particulars of a given analysis such as  queue lengths, demand-to-capacity ratios, average travel speeds, indicators of  safety, quantities of persons and vehicles served, and other performance measures  may be just as or even more important to consider. For this reason, the HCM  provides method for estimating a variety of useful roadway operations  performance measures, and not just methods for determining LOS.
                         
                       A facility’s capacity to serve automobile mode reflects the effects of all motorized  vehicles using the facility, including trucks, RVs, motorcycles, and buses. In  contrast, LOS for the automobile mode reflects the perspective of automobile  drivers and passengers, but not necessarily the perspective of other motorized  vehicles users. Although automobiles are usually the dominant motorized vehicle  type on roadways, analysts should use care in interpreting LOS results in special  cases, such as intermodal-terminal access routes, where truck may dominate.

                <p> These qualities are related to the density of the traffic stream. Unlike speed,  density increases as flow increases up to capacity, resulting in a service measure  that is both perceivable by motorists and is sensitive to a broad range of flows.</p>

                   <h3>Service measures</h3>
            
                <p>  Each level of service represents a range of conditions, as defined by a range in the parameter(s) given below. Thus, level of service is not a discrete condition, but  rather a range of conditions for which boundaries are established. The table below  presents the service measures (namely, performance measures which can be  estimated quantitatively) to determine the LOS for different types of facilities. </p>

                   <h3>So now what is 'highway capacity'?</h3>
            
                <p>  In general, the capacity of a road facility is defined as the maximum sustainable hourly flow rate at which persons or vehicles reasonable can be expected to  traverse a point or a uniform segment of a lane or roadway during a given time  period under prevailing roadway, environmental, traffic, and control conditions.</p>
                    
                    <p>What is a 'base' or 'ideal' condition: In principle, under base or ideal conditions, full speed and capacity can be  achieved. </p>

                <p >  In many capacity analyses, prevailing conditions are not ideal, and computations of  capacity, service flow rate, or level of service must include adjustments to reflect this. Prevailing conditions are generally categorised as roadway, traffic, or control  conditions.</p>

                <p class="l2"> Multi-lane limited access roadways: 2200 pcu/hr/lane.</p>
                <p class="l2"> Freeway/motorway: 2400 pcu/hr/lane.</p>

                   <h3>Capacity of multilane highways</h3>
            
                <p > For multilane Highways, HCM addresses capacity and LOS  analysis for uninterrupted-flow segments of surface multilane highways. In  general, uninterrupted flow may exist on a multilane highway if there are 2 mile  (approx. 3.2 km) or more between traffic signals. Where signals are more closely  space, the facility should be analysed as an urban street.</p>

                <p class="l2"> Many multilane highways will have periodic signalized intersection, even if the  average signal spacing is well over 2 mile. In such cases, the multilane highway  segments that are more than 2 mile away from any signalized intersections are  analysed by using the methodology of this chapter. </p>
                    
                <p class="l2"> Multilane highways generally have four to six lanes (in both directions) with  posted speed limits between 50 to 100 km/h. These highways may be divided by  one or various median types, may be undivided (with only a centreline separating  the directions of flow), or may have a two way right-turn lane. </p>
